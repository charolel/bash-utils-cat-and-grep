Maneskin - I wanna be your slave

I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters

you need this line (6): I wanna be a good boy, I wanna be a gangster
you need this line (7): Because I'm the devil who's searching for redemption

And I'm a lawyer who's searching for redemption
And I'm a killer who's searching for redemption
A motherfucking monster who's searching for redemption

you need this line (13): And I'm a bad guy who's searching for redemption
